## Primary Category Project  
### Background  
Many publishers use categories as a means to logically organize their content.  However, many pieces of content have more than one category. Sometimes it’s useful to designate a primary category for posts (and custom post types). On the front-end, we need the ability to query for posts (and custom post types) based on their primary categories.  

### Your Mission  
Create a WordPress plugin that allows publishers to designate a primary category for posts. We’ve intentionally left implementation details out so you have a chance to show us strategic thinking. The code you write should be secure and performant. When you’re done, send us the code as an archive or a link to a repository. 

## Download
You can install the plugin into WordPress by downloading the zipped file from here.
